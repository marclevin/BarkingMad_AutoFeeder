# BarkingMad Auto-Feeder Extension

## Getting Started

This is a chrome extension that automatically visits [Barking Mad](https://barkingmad.co.za/click-to-feed-2019-2/) and clicks the "Feed" button for you.

On BarkingMad's website there is a page where visitors are able to click an element on the page 5 times per day to contribute half a bowl of food to a hungry dog. This extension will automatically click the element for you, every day, to ensure that the dogs are fed, and you don't miss a chance to contribute.

## Features
